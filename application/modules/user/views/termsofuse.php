    <pre>Last updated: October 20, 2019<br></pre>
    Afrixis.com ("us", "we", or "our") uses terms on the www.afrixis.com website (the "Service"). By using the Service, you consent to the use of terms.<br>
    Our terms Policy explains what terms are, how we use terms, how third-parties we may partner with may use terms on the Service, your choices regarding terms and further information about terms.<br><br>
    <b style="font-size:20px; color:dodgerblue">What are terms</b><br>
    <p>Terms are small pieces of text sent to your web browser by a website you visit. A term file is stored in your web browser and allows the Service or a third-party to recognize you and make your next visit easier and the Service more useful to you.<br>
        Terms can be "persistent" or "session" terms. Persistent terms remain on your personal computer or mobile device when you go offline, while session terms are deleted as soon as you close your web browser.<br></p>
    <b style="font-size:20px; color:dodgerblue">How Afrixis.com uses terms</b><br>
    <p>When you use and access the Service, we may place a number of terms files in your web browser.<br>
        We use terms for the following purposes:<br>
        To enable certain functions of the Service<br>
        To provide analytics<br>
        We use both session and persistent terms on the Service and we use different types of terms to run the Service:<br>
        Essential terms. We may use terms to remember information that changes the way the Service behaves or looks, such as a user's language preference on the Service.<br>
        Analytics terms. We may use analytics terms to track information how the Service is used so that we can make improvements. We may also use analytics terms to test new advertisements, pages, features or new functionality of the Service to see how our users react to them.<br></p>
    <b style="font-size:20px; color:dodgerblue">Third-party terms</b><br>
    <p>In addition to our own terms, we may also use various third-parties terms to report usage statistics of the Service, deliver advertisements on and through the Service, and so on.<br></p>
    <b style="font-size:20px; color:dodgerblue">What are your choices regarding terms</b><br>
